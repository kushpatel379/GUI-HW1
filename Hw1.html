        <h2>Introductions</h2>
        <p> 
            Cheetahs are the fastest land animal on the planet. 
            They live in Africa and can run up to 74 miles per hour in short bursts. Cheetahs are yellow with black spots.
            They are one of the many big cats that live in Africa. They are a vulnerable species as their population in decreasing.
            Less than 7000 adult cheetahs remaining in the wild. Mainly live in eastern and southern Africa. Their bodies are made
            to hunt with speed. Their tail, claws, nose, and more are designed and work in such a way that allow them to run really
            fast. Cheetahs also live alone most of the time. Male cheetahs are the only ones who might live together after they move 
            away from thier mother.

        <p>
            Cheetahs are my favorite animal since I was a kid and they still are. The way they have stripes down their face and how fast
            they run is how they drew my likingness to them. Another reason is that I like to run and cheetahs are fast runners.
            I remember in middle school when we had to do a research paper on an animal and I chose cheetahs. One of my laptop 
            background pictures is a cheetah.
